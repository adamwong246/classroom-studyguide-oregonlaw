Esthetics - Natural Physiological Effects
(1) Per ORS 690.005(5)(a) and (12)(a), an esthetician may use a “mechanical or electrical
apparatus, appliance, or device” that does not penetrate beyond the epidermis except through
natural physiological effects for the following skin care or facial care practices performed on the
human body or face for the purpose of keeping the skin of the human body or face healthy and
attractive: cleansing, stimulating, manipulating, exfoliating, or applying lotions or creams.
(2) “Natural physiological effects” means a natural biological response produced by, or that
follows immediately from, and in accordance with, a person’s normal biological functioning.
(3) “Epidermis” means the outermost layer of the skin. The epidermis does not include any
layers of the skin below the epidermis, including, but not limited to, the dermis and muscle.
(4) An esthetician may not use a “mechanical or electrical apparatus, appliance, or device”
beyond the epidermis. An esthetician is presumed to be using a “mechanical or electrical
apparatus, appliance, or device” below the epidermis when:
(a) The esthetician exfoliates or removes the skin below the epidermal layer.
(b) The esthetician destroys or damages the dermis or muscle.
(5) An esthetician using a “mechanical or electrical apparatus, appliance, or device” can only
use the device within the epidermis. The esthetician’s use of the “mechanical or electrical
apparatus, appliance, or device” within the client’s epidermal skin layer may create a natural
body response that may go deeper than the epidermis. For example, an esthetician can use
microcurrent to stimulate the skin within the epidermis. Any increased cellular metabolism,
activity, or exchange below the epidermis from stimulating the epidermal skin would be the
natural physiological effect from the use of the esthetics device.
